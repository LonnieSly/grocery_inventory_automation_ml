Machine Learning Sales Prediction Project
Inventory Analysis Project Phase 1

🔍 Turning Raw Business Data Into Actionable Insights
The Challenge: Businesses lose thousands daily from poor inventory management - expired products, stockouts, and missed sales opportunities all eating into profits.
My Approach: I dove into real business inventory data to uncover the story hidden in the numbers:
📊 Data Discovery & Cleaning

Processed messy real-world business data using Python & Pandas
Implemented robust date parsing for accurate time-based analysis
Transformed raw data into analysis-ready format

🎯 Strategic Analysis

Identified LOW-STOCK items before stockouts occurred
Flagged EXPIRED products to prevent losses
Discovered TOP-SELLING patterns to optimize procurement

📈 Actionable Deliverables

Created downloadable CSV reports for immediate business action
Built reproducible analysis pipeline using free tools (Google Colab)
Delivered insights that directly impact bottom-line decisions

The Impact: What started as rows of data became a clear roadmap for inventory optimization - helping businesses prevent losses, avoid stockouts, and capitalize on high-performing products.
Key Takeaway: The best data analysis doesn't just find patterns - it tells a story that drives business decisions.

ML Sales Prediction Project (Phase 2)

🤖 When Machine Learning Doesn't Work (And Why That's Still Valuable)
Building on my inventory analysis project, I dove into machine learning to predict sales volumes - and learned some hard truths about real-world data science.
The Ambitious Goal: Can we predict product-level sales using inventory features? Time to find out.
My ML Pipeline:
🔧 Feature Engineering

Selected relevant inventory features from grocery dataset
Applied one-hot encoding for categorical variables
Implemented proper train/test splitting

📈 Model Development

Built linear regression model using Python & scikit-learn
Followed complete ML workflow from data prep to evaluation
Applied rigorous performance metrics (R², MAE)

The Reality Check:

R² = -0.46 (worse than random guessing!)
MAE: ~21 units per prediction
Model performance: Not production-ready

The Real Learning: 🧠
Instead of hiding disappointing results, I diagnosed WHY:

Dataset too small for reliable patterns
Noisy data with inconsistent relationships
Categorical spread creating sparse feature space
Uneven target distribution causing prediction bias

What This Actually Demonstrates:
✅ Complete ML workflow execution
✅ Proper model evaluation & interpretation
✅ Critical thinking about model limitations
✅ Understanding of overfitting/underfitting concepts
✅ Data quality assessment skills
Next Steps I Identified:

Explore classification approaches instead of regression
Test tree-based models for non-linear relationships
Expand dataset or focus on feature engineering
Consider ensemble methods for better performance

Key Insight: In data science, understanding WHY a model fails teaches you more than when it succeeds. Failed experiments with proper analysis are still successful learning experiences.
The best data scientists don't just build models - they know when NOT to deploy them.
